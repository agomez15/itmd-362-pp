## ITMD 362 Production Problem 5: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the color you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode Default with Text; you can start at this URL if you like: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

1. An adjacent color palette for introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=5090u0kkan77Mvad9uvrcfGwGfa
Your Rationale: 
Bright red is a good color to attract peoples attention, and you want to out compete the other consloes so yours gets the most attention. 
Red is also seen as a aggresive color, showing that the console is serious.  



2. A triadic color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=32R0u0kkan71Ulm8xoGwXl6UpoN
Your Rationale:
Spring time already has associated colors that give the impression of "spring" itself. 
This is why green is the first color that will be included, along with brown and the second automatic color. 
Green is associated with plants and nature, so because plants are involved its natural to include green.
Brown is a good secondary color, it is associated with dirt and the earth, a natural pairing with plants and spring.
Purple is the third color in the selection and is more of a vibrant color. When it is spring time new flowers bloom and new colors arrize, creating vibrant scences. 
Purple would complement the vibrantness of floral and plants. 

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for a private messaging app

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=30f0d0kCsKslcN2riLgJVuyKgnF
Your Rationale:
Depending on the context of the application, its still the safe bet to choose a set of "warm" or light, friendly colors. 
Dark colors wont appeal or stand ou as much when the user is picking out a app or scrolling through an app store. 
The warmer colors would also allow a more inviting look to the app, as well as better visual appeal of whatever font u see. 

4. A monochromatic color palette for advertising a course on Ruby on Rails

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kkan73vC53LrhLGiEKCbA
Your Rationale: 
Ruby on Rails already has a red logo, from the actual jewel ruby used.
Since that is the case, it would make sense to keep it near the color sceme and use a shade of red that it close. 
A darker red wouldnt do much to make the course in terms of visablilty, so a lighter shade closer to pink would be better.
