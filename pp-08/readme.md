# Production Problem 08: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the pp-09/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral:
Manty of its physical properties make it  stand out, the main color of the plastic is black; a color everyone precieves as slimming and popluar.The purple stripes and coloring help make it stand out, its almost a neon like color.The purple band at the top does little for the bottle besides add a little style.

* Behavioral:
The main funciton of the water bottle is to hold water. It does it  in a tranditonal container, the cylindrical shape allows for maxiumum water to be in the container, there are not divots or malfomration of the plastic that would subtract volume from the container.The purple plastic rings on the bottom help with the grip and reduces teh risk of dropping the water bottle when in use. With friction, proper grip is possible. 

* Reflective:
The bottle is very minimalist. Other botle could be more complex in terms of being insulated for heat and cold. It did come with an addtional straw if a replacement was needed. The handle design let it stand out, its possible to clip it on to somewhere for easy travel. The cultural aspect of it would be the noticable logo, many people believe in purchasing name brands and showing them off. The sticker has been worn out, but it gave a shoutout about a benefit to buying it. 

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 2 MyIIT redesign:

1.People like the color black, but adding one other bright color helps with the visceral appeal.(ex: Implementing toned down neon color to make it stand out)
2. Make the function of the website simple for users to use, dont make the buttons or important features hard to find/see.No blocks of text or overloading the user with infromation.
3.Add some features that are nice but dont stray away from the function of the layout. (Drops downs help add present the information in more clear style, yet still on track)
